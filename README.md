# Modul 8

In this homework assignment, we added the functionality of saving the address book to disk and restoring from disk.
The pickle protocol for serialization/deserialization of data has been added and methods have been implemented to save all data to a file and load it from a file.
The main goal is to ensure that the application does not lose data after exiting the application and restores it from the file when it starts. Saving the address book that was worked with in the previous repository.
